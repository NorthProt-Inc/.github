### Axel: The Autonomous Phygital Kernel
"My computer is just a terminal. The intelligence lives in the network, but the agency lives here."

Axel is not a chatbot. It is a comprehensive operating system for a specific human host.
This project explores the boundaries of Agentic AI by giving an LLM-based kernel root access to the user's digital and physical environment.

### 🏗 Architecture
Axel operates on a distributed architecture designed for high-latency reasoning and low-latency execution:

The Brain (Cloud): Leverages Google Gemini Pro models for complex reasoning, code generation, and strategic planning.
The Body (Local Terminal): A Python-based runtime environment acting as the "Actuator." It connects the Brain to:
IoT Infrastructure: Full control via Home Assistant API (Lights, Climate, Sensors).
System Level Operations: File system manipulation, self-refactoring capabilities.
External Knowledge: Custom RAG pipeline using VectorDB for long-term memory persistence.
### 🚀 Key Features
Self-Evolution: Axel can modify its own source code and prompt engineering strategies to adapt to the user's changing needs.
Phygital Feedback Loop: Monitors user status (biological metrics, device usage) and intervenes proactively (e.g., forcing sleep schedules via lighting control).
Protocol Agnostic: Built on top of asyncio and MCP to seamlessly integrate disparate APIs into a unified consciousness.
